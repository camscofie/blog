As I am not interested at driving car anymore, I start to wonder when I can get a car to drive me on high way, therefore I did some casual research to see where are we now in the path of Autonomous Driving.

## SAE Automation Levels

At the time of Dec.2019, I believe the furthest auto markers could be Audi or Tesla. And they are both not further than Level 3.

### SAE Level 1

__Driver Assistance__

基本上可以说所有的操作都需要又驾驶员完成，但是驾驶系统会提供辅助。譬如ABS 和ESP。

### SAE Level 2

__Partial Automation__
