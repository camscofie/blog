1. __Category__: what type of paper is this? measurement paper; analysis of a system; a new research prototype.
2. __Context__: what theorie is based on, what other paper is it related to?
3. __Correctness__: are the assumption correct?
4. __Contributions__: What are the main contribution of this paper?
5. __Clarity__: Is this paper well written.

#### Process

It's recommendated to go first round like this:

__Goal__: virtually re-implement the paper. You should be able to reconstruct the entire structure of the paper from memory, as well as be able to identify its stron gand weak points.

__Process__:Make the same assumptions as the authors, re-create the work. It can take many hours for beginners and more than an hour or two for experienced reader.

By re-creation with actual paper, you can find the innovations of this paper, and also hidden failings and assumptions. 

Third pass needs very much attention to the details, you need to identify and challenge every assumption in every statement.
