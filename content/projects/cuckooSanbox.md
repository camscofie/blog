In our campus, we stopped e-mails sent to our address with potential threads, such as attachments with .doc...

This cause a lot of delay for the recipient and very much work for us, administration. Because we need to check email's attachments manually.

Therefore we thought to make a sandbox, which will open the email's attachment automatically, and monitoring it see if it is any suspiciousness. If it doesn't have any threads, then the sandbox will automatically send the e-mail to its original recipient.
